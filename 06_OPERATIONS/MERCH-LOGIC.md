# MERCH LOGIC — LOCKED

This document governs PO mechanics, freebies, edition logic, and fulfillment rules.

## Pricing (locked)
- PO price: **199,000 IDR**  
- Post-PO price: **249,000 IDR**

## PO inclusions (locked)
- **PO buyers receive:** numbered embroidered patch (red yarn border) *if feasible*, numbered card (Divine Bone stock) with slot for `Name added in the Book`, and priority invite to the listening room.  
- **General buyers (post-PO):** card only (no red yarn patch, no wax seal).

**Edition logic:** PO edition includes numbered hand-finish elements to preserve scarcity. Public run excludes red-yarn patch and hand-numbering.

## Fulfillment (basic)
- For small runs, pack tee (folded) with card tucked into fold, patch in bone sleeve (if included). Use minimal kraft mailer.  
- Shipping: local courier for domestic Manado first; international only after reliable sample & QA confirmed.

## Payment & PO capture
- Use bank transfer / Paypal / Stripe depending on effort; a simple form (Typeform / Notion) + payment instructions is acceptable for initial runs.  
- Confirmation email must state delivery estimate and the locked items included.

## Quality rules
- Overlay proof and a signed size-M physical sample must be approved by **Jony Ive** and **James Jebbia** prior to any run (see [[05_DECISIONS/PRODUCTION-SIGNOFF]]).

## Notes
- Do not promise shipping or exact production dates until the sample and overlay proof are signed.  
- Keep PO windows short and invitation-only for first wave.
