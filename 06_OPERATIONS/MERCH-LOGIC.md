# MERCH LOGIC

Operational rules for merch + PO.

- PO mechanics: invite-only; collect payment before production.
- Limited runs: general run = 11 items per drop; PO run variable (record actual number).
- Found variant: PO-only, max 15% of first run (see council decision).

**Production checklist**
- Sample order (M size) before mass run.
- Overlay proof (tee + card) required.
- Packaging pocket die line must be approved.
