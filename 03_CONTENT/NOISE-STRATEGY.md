# NOISE STRATEGY — LOCKED

Purpose: support main ritual stories without explaining lore or showing product. Noise is **interruption**, not explanation.

## Canonical rules (immutable)
- **Background:** Charcoal `#1E1E1E` for all noise posts. (Bone reserved for main weekly stories.)  
- **Text color:** Divine Bone `#F5F1E8`. Do not use pure white.  
- **Structure:** All noise posts must follow Top / Mid / Bottom grammar.  
- **Glyphs:** Include `REGISTRATION_MARKS` (two tiny dots) at baseline, opacity **8%**, unless exception granted.  
- **Accent:** Blood Oath Red `#D43131` allowed **once per frame** only; Halo Ember Gold reserved for PO/physical finish.  
- **Captions:** Default for noise feed posts = **none**. Exception only by formal council sign-off (single word or ritual fragment).

## Design & export constraints
- Working canvas: Story 1080×1920 px (300ppi source), Feed 1080×1080 px (300ppi source).  
- Typography (300ppi working file): Top = 42 pt; Mid = 64 pt; Bottom = 28 pt. Line-height 120–130%.  
- Glyphs: two dots, diameter **2.5 mm** (~30 px at 300dpi), aligned beneath text baseline. Opacity 8%.

## Noise classification workflow
1. Author prepares candidate asset (Mark as `noise_candidate`).  
2. Ops verifies: Charcoal bg, glyph present, accent ≤1, caption empty.  
3. If passes → schedule. If not → return to author.

**Why this exists:** Noise trains patience and sets expectation. It is a structural feature, not an aesthetic fad.
