# NOISE STRATEGY

Purpose: support the main rhythm without explaining.

Rules:
- Noise clarifies *values*, not products.
- Noise must never show product samples.
- Use bone/charcoal visual discipline.
- Keep copy minimal or none.

Examples:
- “We are not ready to show anything.” — Story (week 5 noise)
- “Scarcity is discipline.” — Feed (week 7 noise)
