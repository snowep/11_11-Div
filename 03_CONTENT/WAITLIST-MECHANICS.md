# WAITLIST — NAME IN THE BOOK (LOCKED)

**Offer (locked):** When users sign up they receive:
- Priority PO invitation (first access).  
- A numbered line in the Book (email confirmation only — private).  
- Immediate downloadable: a single sigil wallpaper (Divine Bone) upon signup.

**Form fields (minimum):**
- Full name  
- Email address  
- One-line reason (optional): "Why curiosity?" (optional field)

**Mechanics:**
1. Use simple Typeform / Notion form and pipe responses to a Google Sheet.  
2. Save a copy of the Google Sheet to Obsidian (private) weekly.  
3. Do not sell or share the list. Use only for PO priority invites and controlled ambassador outreach.

**Privacy:** Keep emails private and encrypted where possible; do not use list for mass marketing.

**Notes:** The waitlist is a ledger, not a pre-order. It records witnesses, not buyers. Exact PO mechanics are in [[06_OPERATIONS/MERCH-LOGIC]].
