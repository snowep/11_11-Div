## Week 8 special rule (conditional)
- **Allowed only if**: both Feb 9 (Mon) and Feb 11 (Wed) story frames are *visually identical* and the second post reads as a deliberate echo (no added motion, no explanatory text).  
- If the two-story execution differs materially → **cancel Wed post** and reschedule echo as a quiet feed note in a future week.

(Reason: two identical-story sequence is a patience exercise; different visuals risk becoming explanation.)

## Pre-publish checklist (for each item)
Before scheduling/publishing any Story or Feed for these weeks, confirm:

- [ ] Visual asset exported: PNG (1080×1350 for Feed; 1080×1920 for Story).  
- [ ] Master vector saved: `design/MASTER_FULL.svg` (or relevant file) and linked in Obsidian.  
- [ ] Story audio prepared (if required) and trimmed to 10–12s loop.  
- [ ] Caption drafted (if any) — follow rules in [[CONTENT-PHILOSOPHY]] (prefer minimal).  
- [ ] Post scheduled at correct ritual time (Story = 11:11 PM, Feed = 8:41 PM).  
- [ ] Noise risk check: does the visual introduce any new symbol or color? (If yes → veto.)  
- [ ] Save post-report in [[03_CONTENT/POST-LOG]] (date, quick notes, engagement highlights).

## Post-publish logging (fill after each post)
Create a small note and link it here after publishing:

- `03_CONTENT/POST-LOG/2026-01-19-story-we-are-not-ready.md` → Save: impressions, top comments to preserve, any notable reactions. Link the post media in the note.
