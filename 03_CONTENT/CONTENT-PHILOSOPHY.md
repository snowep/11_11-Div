# CONTENT PHILOSOPHY

Short rules for everything public.

- No explanation. Prefer paradox. Use Top / Mid / Bottom line structure.
- Repetition is not failure — it's branding.
- Prefers visual abstraction; avoid lifestyle photography until product exists.
- Stories lead, feed preserves.

## Checklist for each public piece
- Does it avoid explanation? (Y/N)  
- Does it preserve ritual timing? (Y/N)  
- Does it reference core palette? (Y/N)
