# RELIC 001 — SPECIFICATION & INTENT (LOCKED)

**Canonical object:** straight, archetypal sacred longsword (Type XV–inspired) — intentionally culturally ambiguous.

**Fracture baseline (locked):** 48.5% of full master height. (Master canvas: height 4000 px → baseline = 1940 px; record in `MASTER_FULL` metadata as `fracture_baseline_px=1940`.)

## Distribution logic (locked)
- **Upper half** (handle → fracture) = garment print (TEE) — general run.  
- **Lower half** (fracture → point) = collectible card / relic token — PO-only collectible and numbered artifact.

## Visual rules
- The sword silhouette is restrained: clean blade, simple guard, minimal crown motif integrated into guard/pommel (partially broken).  
- Fracture is a clean, geometric diagonal cut — not ragged, not decorative.  
- Sigils should be geometric derivatives of the fracture geometry (one sigil per drop). Sigils are small and tone-on-tone.

## Meaning of ownership (locked)
Owning Relic 001 implies:
- You are a **witness** — a numbered token is recorded in the Book.  
- You receive **ritual access** — priority PO invitation and limited listening-room access.

## Export & production requirements
- Provide `MASTER_FULL` AI/SVG vector with required layers (see [[04_DESIGN/DESIGN-SYSTEM]]).  
- Produce `UPPER_EXPORT` and `LOWER_EXPORT` files. Ensure `PRINT_SAFE` variants exist (no hairlines).  
- Overlay proof (`OVERLAY_PROOF.png`) must be generated and signed before any production.
