# LAYOUT RULES

- Generous negative space: do not fill frames.  
- Text hierarchy: Top (small), Mid (tiny), Bottom (bold).  
- Align visual anchor to vertical center, fracture slightly above center for tee placement.  
- Registration glyphs: opacity 6–10%, functional only on `REGISTRATION_MARKS` layer.
