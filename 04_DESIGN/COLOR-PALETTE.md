# COLOR PALETTE — LOCKED

Primary:
- **Divine Bone** — `#F5F1E8` (canonical main story background)  
- **Worn Charcoal** — `#1E1E1E` (text, noise background)

Accents (reserved, PO-only):
- **Blood Oath Red** — `#D43131` (single small accents; max one per frame)  
- **Halo Ember Gold** — `#F2C55E` (foil or plastisol accent; PO-only)

**Hierarchy rule (immutable):**  
- **Bone** = canonical main story backgrounds.  
- **Charcoal** = noise / interruption backgrounds.  
- Do not invert this grammar except by formal council decision.

**Contrast rule:** Never use pure white or pure black on-screen; use Divine Bone or Worn Charcoal depending on background.

**See:** [[03_CONTENT/NOISE-STRATEGY]] | [[04_DESIGN/DESIGN-SYSTEM]]
