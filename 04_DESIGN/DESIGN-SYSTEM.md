# DESIGN SYSTEM — Master rules

This is the source of truth for visual law.

- Palette: [[COLOR-PALETTE]]
- Relic rules: [[RELIC-SWORD]]
- Layout rules: [[LAYOUT-RULES]]
- Production constraints: strokes ≥ 0.8 mm, print-safe variants required

## Quick export checklist (for designers)
- Export master vector file `MASTER_FULL` (AI/SVG)  
- Produce `TEE_PRINT_SAFE` and `CARD_PRINT` (PNG 300dpi + PDF)  
- Provide overlay proof: card aligned to tee baseline
