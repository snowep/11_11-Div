# SESSION ZERO — World Calibration

Definition: a state-change, not a launch.

**Outputs expected by end of Session Zero:**
- Rhythm established (10 weeks)
- Small group of engaged followers
- Master vector for relic (see [[RELIC-SWORD]])
- No product launch until proofs are approved

**Checks**
- Weekly post cadence met? (checkbox)  
- Overlay proof (tee + card) approved? (checkbox → see [[DESIGN-SYSTEM]])

**Do not**: explain the lore publicly. Let puzzle remain.
