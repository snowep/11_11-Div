# VALUES — Non-negotiable

List only enforced values. Each entry includes a short rule.

- **Restraint** — remove before adding. (Rule: if unsure, delete.)  
- **Discipline** — repeat, don't explain.  
- **Intentional Scarcity** — limited by design (Rule: fewer than 20% promo runs).  
- **Silence as Signal** — information withheld unless necessary.

## Use
Link these in creative briefs and decision checkpoints: [[DECISION-CRITERIA]] (create if needed).
