# VALUES — LOCKED (enforced)

These are the enforced operational values that guide *what we do* and *what we refuse*.

## Core values
- **Restraint.** Remove before adding. If you hesitate, remove.  
- **Discipline.** Repeat the ritual; do not explain it away.  
- **Scarcity by design.** Editions, reserved variants, and short windows are deliberate tools.  
- **Silence as signal.** Default is to withhold explanation; the work must invite inquiry.

## Forbidden actions (immutable)
1. Paying for followers or gaming hashtag algorithms.  
2. Explicit public explanation of scripture, verse, or religious doctrine in product or marketing communication.  
3. Publicly showing product samples before overlay proof and dual physical sample sign-off.

## Usage
- Use this file as the first filter in any brief. If an action violates any of these items, the action is vetoed until reassessed in a council cycle.
