# VALUES — LOCKED (enforced)

These are the enforced, operational values that the brand must honor on every public and product decision.

## Core values
- **Restraint** — remove before adding. If in doubt, remove.  
- **Discipline** — repetition over explanation. Ritual over hype.  
- **Scarcity by design** — limited runs, reserved variants, and clear edition logic.  
- **Silence as signal** — withhold explanation as default; allow curiosity to work.

## Forbidden actions (immutable)
1. Paying for followers or gaming hashtag algorithms.  
2. Explicitly explaining scripture in public brand content.  
3. Showing product samples before overlay proof *and* a signed physical prototype.

## How to use the values
- Use these as hard filters in briefs and approvals.  
- If a proposal fails any one of these checks, it is rejected or sent back for revision.
