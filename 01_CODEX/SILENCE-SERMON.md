# SILENCE SERMON

Short doctrine about absence and waiting.

- Silence is not emptiness; it is selection.
- We do not explain the bible. We bury hints in artifacts.
- No explanatory captions; allow the curious to decode.

## Practical rules
- No product images until we have physical samples and a lock from [[LOCKED-DECISIONS]].
- Max 1 explanatory post per quarter — measured, not narrative.
