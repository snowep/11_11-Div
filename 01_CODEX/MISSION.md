# MISSION — LOCKED

**We make scarce, silent artifacts that teach noticing, not consuming.**

**Why this matters (short):**  
This sentence is the judge for every design, content, and operational decision. It is not a slogan. It is a *rule*. Ask: does this action teach noticing rather than selling? If no — reject.

**Refusals (non-negotiable)**  
- We will not publicly explain scripture, dogma, or sacred text in product or marketing posts.  
- We will not buy attention via paid follower lists, hashtag farming, or artificial engagement.  
- We will not show product samples publicly before overlay proof *and* signed physical sample approval from the production sign-off panel.

**Operational note:**  
This file is canonical and locked. Any amendment requires a formal council cycle and vote.

_Signed-off-by: Council (full roster) — 2026-01-20._
