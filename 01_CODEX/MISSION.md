# MISSION — LOCKED

**We make scarce, silent artifacts that teach noticing, not consuming.**

**Why this matters (short):**  
This sentence is the judge for every design, content, and operational decision. It is not a slogan to use in ads — it is a rule for rejection and selection.

**Refusals (non-negotiable)**  
- We will not explain scripture, dogma, or sacred text in product posts.  
- We will not buy attention (paid follower lists, hashtag-farming).  
- We will not show product samples publicly before overlay proof *and* physical sample sign-off.

**Quick operational use:**  
Before any creative action, ask: *Does this help teach noticing rather than selling?* If no — reject.
