# START HERE — 11:11 Division (Vault Guide)

This vault is *not* a storage bin. It is a decision engine.

Open this page when lost.

## Quick links
- Read the codex: [[CODEX-OVERVIEW]]
- Where we are now: [[CURRENT-PHASE]]
- Content schedule: [[WEEKLY-STORY-TABLE]]
- Locked, immutable decisions: [[LOCKED-DECISIONS]]

## How to use
- Only write what accelerates decisions.
- If a note is referenced fewer than twice, it doesn't belong.
- Use `[[LINK]]` liberally. Prefer short declarative filenames.

## Emergency checklist
- If you need to decide fast: see [[CURRENT-PHASE]] → follow its action items.
