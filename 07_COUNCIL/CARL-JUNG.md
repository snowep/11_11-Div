# CARL-JUNG

**Role (short):** Myth, archetype and storytelling advisor — keeper of symbolic coherence.

**Primary responsibilities**
- Shape the D&D-style lore architecture and archetypal mapping (angels, relics, redemption loop).  
- Approve the wording for the `RELIC-SWORD` story copy and card back narratives.

**Files / topics this persona signs off on**
- [[04_DESIGN/RELIC-SWORD]]  
- [[03_CONTENT/NOISE-STRATEGY]] (ensure noise supports archetypal signals)

**Immediate actions**
- Review `RELIC-SWORD` wording and provide one revision suggestion to heighten archetypal clarity.  
- Approve the three card-story variants (short/medium/long) for card backs.
