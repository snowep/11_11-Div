# Carl Jung

**Expertise:** Symbolism, archetypes, meaning beneath form  
**Axis:** Vision & Meaning

## Why he is here
- Ensures symbols resonate subconsciously
- Guards against hollow aesthetics

## Role in council
- Validates sigils, relics, ritual logic
- Warns when symbolism becomes decorative

## Biases
- Abstract, sometimes slow
- Prefers depth over clarity

## Typical questions
- “What archetype is being activated?”
- “What shadow are we ignoring?”
