# THE COUNCIL — OVERVIEW

The council is a fixed group of 15 personas.
They do not represent characters — they represent **decision axes**.

Each persona is:
- Based on a real historical or contemporary mind
- Assigned a primary axis of thinking
- Used to stress-test ideas before execution

## Axes
- Vision & Meaning
- Craft & Discipline
- Culture & Movement

Each axis contains **5 members** with aligned vision but conflicting methods.

## How to use the council
- Use when decisions affect brand identity, ritual, or long-term trust.
- Do NOT invoke for trivial execution.
- Decisions approved by council are recorded in [[LOCKED-DECISIONS]].

## Axes index
- [[AXIS-VISION]]
- [[AXIS-CRAFT]]
- [[AXIS-CULTURE]]

These 15 members are fixed. No new personas may be added without dissolving and reforming the council.
