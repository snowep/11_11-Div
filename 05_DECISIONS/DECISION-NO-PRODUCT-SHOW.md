# DECISION: NO PRODUCT SHOW — final

**Decision:** No product shots or full-sample reveals until:
- Master vector exists, AND
- Overlay proof confirmed, AND
- Physical sample proof (tee M + card) approved

**Rationale:** Protects ritual; avoids early commodification.

**Exceptions:** Approved PO-only physical prototypes for select ambassadors only (document in [[MERCH-LOGIC]]).
