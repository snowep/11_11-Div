# AFTER WEEK 10 — IMMEDIATE RULE (LOCKED)

**Decision:** Pause public postings for **14 days** after Week 10 (no new public content).

**Purpose:**  
- Create ceremonial space; avoid panic reveals.  
- Prepare the first controlled digital proof and the waitlist activation flow.  
- Allow the council and ops to finalize production rules and any PO mechanics.

**Post-pause action:** After the 14-day pause, the brand will:
1. Release one short controlled motion piece (Version B recommended — motion-graphic `Diagram Align`).  
2. Open priority PO access to the waitlist (as defined in [[03_CONTENT/WAITLIST-MECHANICS]]) if the production rules are signed off.  
3. Continue with a phase plan determined by the council.

**Note:** This rule is immutable — any change requires a formal council cycle.
